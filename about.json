  "description2": "Welcome to Bhutia Khayrab Yargay Tshogpo. We are a dedicated team of professionals passionate about delivering high-quality products and services to our customers. Denjongke is a Tibetic (Tournadre 2008: 283) language, spoken in the formerly independent kingdom of Sikkim, which is now a state of India. One of the most closely related languages within the Tibetic family is Dzongkha, the official language of Bhutan. The Census of India 2001 lists 41,825 speakers for Denjongke, whereas a few Denjongke language teachers have given estimates of some 25–30,000 speakers at present. The exact number of speakers is difficult to determine because many young ethnic Denjongpas either do not speak the language or have a very limited knowledge of it. Moreover, many Lepchas living close to Denjongpas are reported to speak Denjongke. Denjongke grammar has been described by Sandberg (1888, 1895). Walsh (1905), Grierson ([1909] 1967) and Shafer (1974) also provide some lexical data and historical-comparative observations on Denjongke phonology. Sandberg (1895: 44-45) gives a brief list of sentences illustrating Denjongke copulas (which he calls “substantive verbs”) but his description is not very detailed. References to Sandberg (1895), when relevant, are given later in this article. The most common endonym of the language is Lhoke2 ‘southern language’, while Denjongke3 is a pan-Tibetan term better understood by other Tibetan-related communities. In India, the language is widely known as (Sikkimese) Bhutia, and in the Ethnologue (Lewis et al. 2013) as Sikkimese. The dialects of the Northern villages of Lachen and Lachung are called by the names of these villages.",
